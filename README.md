A multilingual translation & AI image generation chat app (for learning purposes).
This project is based on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) solo project.

## How this project was built

Initially, with AI(copilot) tab proposal assistance, I drafted the CSS and HTML.
Afterward, I completed this project through AI-driven development: asking questions, implementing instructions, bug checking, and code critique.
If I don't understand code suggested or generated by AI, ask the AI to explain it, and only adopt it once I'm personally satisfied with the explanation.
Every line was **reviewed, tested, and either kept with confidence or rewritten/deleted by me**  
 → The final code contains only what I'm confident in and take responsibility for

## Overview

- Translate input text into multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, Japanese) using AI
- AI-powered image generation feature
- Chat-style history display and editing
- Error handling included

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS
- Backend API: OpenAI API (accessed via /api/openai, API key managed server-side)

## Main Features

- Text translation (using OpenAI API)
- AI image generation
- Chat history display
- Language switching (EN/ES/FR/JA)
- Error message display

## Security

- API key is hidden on the server side and never exposed to the client

## Setup & Usage

**Security note**

- Make sure your .env.local file (containing your API key) is listed in .gitignore and never committed to your repository.

### Setup with Vercel + OpenAI API

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd translation-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm install openai
   ```

3. **Prepare your OpenAI API key**

   - Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Create a `.env.local` file and add:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
     ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**

   - Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account and import your project
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in Project Settings > Environment Variables
   - Deploy: the serverless API (`/api/openai`) will be enabled automatically

5. **Local development (optional)**
   ```sh
   npx vercel dev
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   to start the local server

### Using OpenAI API Directly from the Frontend with Vite (for learning/testing only)

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm install vite
   ```

2. **Add your OpenAI API key to .env.local**

   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. **Call the API directly from the frontend**

   - Example: `import { OpenAI } from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI({
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY
});`
   - Implement API requests directly in `index.js`, etc.

4. **Start the Vite dev server**
   ```sh
   npx vite
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

**Note**

- This method exposes your API key to the frontend. **Never use it in production.**
- For learning/testing/personal use only.
